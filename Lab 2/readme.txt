Please refer to the .html file for a static view of the notebook. The notebook was run
locally, and while it has been tested to be able to run on Google Colab we cannot confirm
that the results will be 100% acccurate despite setting seed already. This is because Google
Colab uses different hardware, even at run time and the hardware configuration (i.e. CPU/GPU) 
affects the seed, thus making it less predictable still.

1. Uncomment first cell block if in Google Colab
2. Drag and drop items in './data' folder into Google Colab
3. Update FILE_PATH to data in the fourth cell.
